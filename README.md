# CS-330-Final-Project
•	How do I approach designing software?
Throughout the project, I made sure to read and understand the OpenGL APIs before starting to implement it on my project. Also, I broke down the requirements into smaller tasks and worked on them one by one. In the real world, each developer gets assigned tasks from a project and combines all the work in the end to bring out the new product.

•	How do I approach developing programs?
Well, I did not use any new development strategies while working on this project. I worked on this like any other I have worked in the past. Each week, I implemented one feature at a time and bring them all together for the final project. My approach for this project was to modularize as much code as possible and add functions to decrease the line of code in the main function.

•	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It gave me a lot of knowledge and insight about how to render 3D graphics on a computer and how can OpenGL APIs be used for the gaming industry.
